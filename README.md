# Syncify
An application to process MP3 files so that they can be played in order in cars equipped with Ford Sync.

Unlike pretty much every other MP3 player on the planet the Ford Sync audio system does not play MP3s in Track or Filename order - it orders by Title instead.

This means that, even if you have a carefully catalogued music collection, it will not play album tracks in order.

For instance Purple Rain will be played alphabeticaly, like so:

Baby I'm a Star
Computer Blue
Darling Nikki
I Would Die 4 U
Let's Go Crazy
Purple Rain
Take Me With U
The Beautiful Ones
When Doves Cry

Syncify is a simple application that re-writes the title of MP3 files, by adding the track number to the beginning.

You can now listen to Purple Rain in the sequence Prince intended:

01 Let's Go Crazy
02 Take Me With U
03 The Beautiful Ones
04 Computer Blue
05 Darling Nikki
06 When Doves Cry
07 I Would Die 4 U
08 Baby I'm a Star
09 Purple Rain
