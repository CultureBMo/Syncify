# Syncify
An application to process MP3 files so that they can be played in order in Ford cars equipped with the Sync audio system.

Unlike pretty much every other MP3 player on the planet the Ford Sync audio system does not play MP3s in Track or Filename order - it orders by Title instead.

This means that, even if you have a carefully catalogued music collection, it will not play album tracks in order.

For instance Purple Rain will be played alphabeticaly, like so:

Baby I'm a Star<br/>
Computer Blue<br/>
Darling Nikki<br/>
I Would Die 4 U<br/>
Let's Go Crazy<br/>
Purple Rain<br/>
Take Me With U<br/>
The Beautiful Ones<br/>
When Doves Cry

Syncify is a simple application that re-writes the title of MP3 files, by adding the track number to the beginning.

You can now listen to Purple Rain in the sequence Prince intended:

01 Let's Go Crazy<br/>
02 Take Me With U<br/>
03 The Beautiful Ones<br/>
04 Computer Blue<br/>
05 Darling Nikki<br/>
06 When Doves Cry<br/>
07 I Would Die 4 U<br/>
08 Baby I'm a Star<br/>
09 Purple Rain

Syncify also includes an option to remove images from files and folders. They are not displayed by Ford Sync and this option helps to save space.
